This is in response to your September 6, 2016 letter signed by Laura Simram 
with the reference: July Quarterly Report (04/01/2016-06/30/2016).  The 
contribution made to Van Hollen for Senate Committee on June 1, 2016 was
 to reduce the candidate committee's debts and not for a primary election.  We 
made an error in our July 15, 2016 quarterly report and will transmit an amended 
report today.  

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Jon Dowie.
